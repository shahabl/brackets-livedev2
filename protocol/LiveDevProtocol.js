/**
 * Provides the protocol that Brackets uses to talk to a browser instance for live development.
 * Protocol methods are converted to a JSON message format, which is then sent over a provided
 * low-level transport and interpreted in the browser. For messages that expect a response, the
 * response is returned through a promise as an object.
 *
 * Events raised by the remote browser are dispatched as jQuery "event" events, with the first
 * parameter being the client ID of the remote browser, and the second parameter being the 
 * message object.
 *
 * Also proxies through the "launch" and "close" methods and the "connect" and "close" events
 * to/from the underlying transport.
